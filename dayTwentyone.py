'''Python has the module called statistics and we can use this module to do all the statistical calculations. 
However, to learn how to make function and reuse function let us try to develop a program, which calculates the
 measure of central tendency of a sample (mean, median, mode) and measure of variability (range, variance, standard deviation). 
 In addition to those measures, find the min, max, of the sample. You can create a class 
 called Statistics and create all the functions that do statistical calculations as methods for the Statistics class. Check the output 
 below.'''
